# Website-
It was done on Codepen , because Github was very time extensive in learning how to use it , and we honestly immidiately started enthusiastically working on the project itself  . 
We honestly only remembered about the github part only one two days before submission . 
While a stupid mistake on our part , we are ver sorry about that . 
Please dont fail us , as we worked really really hard on this website .
